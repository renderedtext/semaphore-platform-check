Semaphore platform check
========================

This is a simple script that outputs the versions
of most important packages on the Semaphore Platform.

To run it you can simply add this project on Semaphore
and setup your build commands with the following:

```bash
sh platform.sh
```

and then run a build to list the package versions.
